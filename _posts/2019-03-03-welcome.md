My name is Jean Melo and I am a (research) software engineer interested in making software that is highly-configurable, reusable, robust, and easy to maintain.

This blog will be where I will post my learnings/views on software development and product management.

Feel free to get in touch with me via email at <a href="mailto:jmelo@configit.com" title="Email me">jmelo@configit.com</a>.
